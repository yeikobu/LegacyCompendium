During such time, she learned to be an Animagus, learning to transform into a gazelle. Just before her fourth year, she transferred to Hogwarts when her mother took up a role as professor of Divination. She had to learn how to use a wand at Hogwarts, as hardly anyone at Uagadou used one, and Natsai still found wandless magic to be more instinctive and convenient. \n\nDuring the 1890–1891 school year, she choose to take Ancient Runes as an elective class, although in fact her mother had elected it for her. \n\nOn 2 September 1890, when the new fifth-year student arrived to Charms class, she invited them to sit beside her.",

Born to two professors at the school who died when he was young, he and his sister, Anne, were raised by their uncle Solomon Sallow, an ex-Auror. When Anne was cursed by Victor Rookwood, she developed a seemingly incurable illness. He tried everything from Nurse Blainey to St Mungo's to no avail, and eventually became convinced that the Dark Arts was the last hope for her. \n\nFrom an early age, he had a mastery of the Unforgivable Curses, and considered other curses such as Confringo to be among his favourites. His quest to unravel the secrets of Dark Magic, justified by finding his sister's cure, eventually culminated in the murder of his uncle, possibly resulting in Sebastian's expulsion from Hogwarts and trial at the Ministry of Magic.",

They were raised by two professors who ingrained a thirst for knowledge into them, but also a sense of optimism and open-mindedness, which Sebastian would later hope to emulate.

Heading into their fourth year at Hogwarts, their house was raided by Ranrok and his followers, causing Anne to be harmed and cursed.

By the age of fifteen, he was capable of casting all three Unforgivable Curses himself, even though they required extraordinary willpower and a real desire to commit evil in order to cast. Sebastian's range of spells were notably offensive, favouring spells such as the Blasting Curse, and often jumping to the Unforgivable Curses by mere instinct. Even as a young wizard, he was addicted to dark spell books such as Slytherin's Spellbook, and enthralled by darker tomes such as Magick Moste Evile. Sebastian justified his interest in the Dark Arts by claiming it was to find a cure for his sister Anne; however, not only did Anne not wish to be cured in this way, but Sebastian also seemed to genuinely enjoy the Dark Arts regardless, finding it 'incredible' that he was able to possess Inferi in the catacombs of Feldcroft.",

          "charisma and manipulation": "Sebastian was a highly charismatic and confident individual, which not only impressed his fellow students, but allowed him to sway and manipulate his closest friends as well. He was capable of convincing Ominis Gaunt to open Slytherin's Scriptorium, something that initially Ominis was heavily reluctant to do, by appealing to Ominis' desire to learn the truth about his missing aunt. When challenged on his use of the Dark Arts, he repeatedly promised both Ominis and his friend that whatever mission he was doing would be his last venture and then he would stop, before simply continuing to push the boundary further. Solomon Sallow was the only individual that Sebastian was unable to sway, which irritated him greatly.",
          "love": "Despite his many faults, Sebastian had an enormous devotion to his twin sister, Anne Sallow, to the point that he would willingly sacrifice his own code of morality to attempt to save her.

Despite being born into a family of dark wizards, he developed a deep distrust towards the Dark Arts, and often found himself in conflicts with his friend Sebastian Sallow over how they should be used.",
        "biography": "He was a descendant of Salazar Slytherin, born into the pure-blood House of Gaunt to a Mr and Mrs Gaunt, two dark wizards. He was born blind, and no spell was able to reverse it. After this, he took to using his wand, which was 'almost sentient', to navigate his way around. \n\nHis upbringing resulted in trauma that made him pessimistic, distrusting of people, and sarcastic. He disagreed with his family's use of the Dark Arts, which aligned him with his favourite aunt, Noctua Gaunt, who herself wished to change the family's traditions and uncover more about Salazar Slytherin's legacy. Ominis was dismayed to find out that she had died in her attempt to navigate Slytherin's Scriptorium. \n\nWhen he was a child, he refused to perform the Cruciatus Curse, which his older siblings and parents often performed on Muggles 'for sport'. This resulted in his own family using the curse on him, creating a division between him and his family that never healed.

Even though he understood Sebastian to be manipulating him, he still felt a duty to try to stop his descent into darkness as the only person that he trusted. Furthermore, after the traumatic experiences of his childhood, he made a genuine and radical attempt to distance himself from his family and their culture of the Dark Arts."

She would visit the room many more times throughout her schooling, at one point forgetting her school bag there, which she recovered only while showing the room to a new student during the 1890–1891 school year, much to her delight. \n\nAfter graduating, Matilda joined the British Ministry of Magic as a Curse-Breaker. Her calming presence and extraordinary wandwork allowed her to rise quickly through the ranks. Around this time, Matilda also befriended Chiyo Kogawa, a Mahoutokoro-educated witch of the Japanese Ministry of Magic, whom she stayed in touch with over the years that followed. \n\nAt some point during her Ministry career, Matilda met and fell in love with a Curse-Breaker named Paul, who reciprocated her feelings, and before long, Matilda had resigned her position at the Ministry in favour of travelling the world with him as freelance Curse-Breakers. With time, however, Matilda began to miss her family, the stability of a settled life, and the camaraderie of working with a talented group of witches and wizards. As Paul had no desire to 'stop moving', their romance ended, and Matilda settled back down in Britain by herself. \nAt some point, she worked with Chiyo Kogawa in Yokohama, a time described as 'eventful'. \n\nAt some point before the 1890s, Matilda became the professor of Transfiguration at Hogwarts, and proved herself to be a stern yet fair-minded instructor regarded for her ability to combine a good sense of humour with an air of authority. She was also eventually promoted to the position of Deputy Headmistress, in which capacity her students found her to be 'lightly intimidating'. \n\nAt the start of the 1890–1891 school year, a new student with the power to see and control ancient magic was enrolled at the school to start as a fifth-year, as they had acquired their magical powers later in life.

        "biography": "After being raised largely in the Muggle world, Satyavati Shah took an interest in the sciences, which she carried with her into her schooling at Hogwarts. She also had a sister named Suchrita. In her youth, she began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where she was Sorted into Ravenclaw house. \n\nAfter graduating, she eventually took up a position as professor of Astronomy and devoted herself to her subject in a way that most would find monastic and extreme. Like her scientific subject, she could come off to her pupils as a bit cold and demanding. She was easily carried away when talking about the heavens and viewed many of the other Hogwarts disciplines (like Divination) as wishy-washy. \n\nProfessor Shah's sister Suchrita, with whom she kept a correspondence through letters, had a similar interest in Astronomy. In 1890, Satyavati and Suchrita were planning to take a trip later in the year to the site of Jantar Mantar, New Delhi, a place that consisted of 13 architectural astronomy instruments. Suchrita mentioned in one letter to Satyavati and expressed joy in getting to go on such an adventure with her sister. In the same letter, Suchrita also disclosed to Satyavati regarding Satyavati and Suchrita's theory that her Cambridge contacts had been wrong in their understanding of meteor showers, and told her that Muggle astronomers had developed a way to calculate the position of dust at Earth's orbit in order to link meteors to comets.",
